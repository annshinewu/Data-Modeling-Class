In the assignment The World of Tomorrow, each student had to create a database for an innovative business idea for the future. I chose the business idea of a Department of Air Traffic, which is based on the prediction that we will eventually begin to fly cars in the air. The department will mainly be responsible for conducting flying tests, selling/buying/registering flying licenses, and also submitting flying laws for voting in the government.
In the process of completing the project, I found myself struggling most with coming up with the first draft of the ER diagram. This included deciding the entity sets, relationships, and attributes in the database. It was incredibly hard as I had virtually no idea what would or would not be suitable for the database. Eventually, I found that I should make a brief idea or description of what type of information the database should store, then start to work from the idea. From the experience, I have improved my skills to work and implement an abstract idea instead of a concrete description specifying every detail in the database. I believe that this skill is incredibly important as a programmer as, in the future, programmers will encounter many instances of working for customers that do not a single clue on how databases work. However, as the hired employees, programmers must still be able to deliver the product even with a rather vague and abstract idea. 
In summary, I have enjoyed working on the project and hope to have more chances in the future to work on extensive projects where we get the chance to design our own ideas and create our own databases.
