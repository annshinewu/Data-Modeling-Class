9/29 Today, we learned about the functional dependency in relational models. Functional dependency is similar to finding a primary key for a relation. There are 2 main rules on functional dependency which are:
1. The tuple on the left side of the functional dependency must only have one tuple on the right side.
2. Any subset of the left tuple will not be able to have only one tuple on the right side.
We did one main classroom exercise on this about the relational model we made last class about artists, albums, and songs.
