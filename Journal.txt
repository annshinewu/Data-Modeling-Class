9/26 Today we learned about a new topic, relational models. Instead of drawing E/R diagrams, we make relation tables for each entity sets and relationships, depending on its characteristics. Entity sets will become relations with its own attributes. Relationships will contain its own attributes and also the key attributes of its related entity sets. Weak entity sets will also include the key attributes of its supporting entity set. However, weak relationships will not have a relation schema because all of its information will become repetitive, thus redundant and can be deleted. With this new knowledge, we worked on an exercise with albums, artists, musicians, songs, and recording companies and converted an E/R diagram into a relational model.
