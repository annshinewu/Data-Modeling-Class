10/17 Today, each group presented their real life database. Joseph and I's database is used to model the sales for an online or retail store. Alex and Sabrina's database is used to model a more complicated system about sales. A real life example can be amazon or ebay. Andrew and Clement's database is used to model a car catalog. Then, we discussed about the Boyce-Codd Normal Form and was asked to explain it to a 8 year old.
