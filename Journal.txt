10/24 Today, we did not learn new information, instead we worked on our midterm project. My project is based on the global average temperatures. For this, I must create the ER diagram and the relational schemas in the first, second, and third normalization forms. I completed the ER diagarm today and also completed the description for the database and ER diagram.
