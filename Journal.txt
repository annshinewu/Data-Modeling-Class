9/22 Today, we had a warmup assignment with a partner. There were 3 scenarios and each group chose one to complete and present. Our group chose scenario 2. It was about an exam database. We considered several possiblities to add entities, then concluded that the improved diagram was better because it considered more possibilties, presented new information, and simplified the attributes of Exam.
