10/3 Today we learned about normalization. The first form of normalization require the value of any attribute in a tuple must have a single value from the domain. The second form of normalization is based on the rule that all non-key attributes are fully functionally dependent on the primary key. We talked about variuos examples of 2nd form of normalization examples we found online and explained it to the class.
