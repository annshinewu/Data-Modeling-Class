10/20 Today, we learned about the BNCF, which is the 3.5 Normalization Form. To test whether a relational schema is in BNCF, we must test whether parts of the nonkey attribute deterines parts of the key attributes, if so, then it is not in Boyce Codd Normalization Form. Then, we had to choose databases for our Midterm Project using Kaggle.com. It was hard to choose the databases because some things were hard to understand. So I had to change my topic a few times.
