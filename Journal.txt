10/26 Today, we worked on midterm project. Using the ER diagram I made last class, I converted the ER diagram into a relational schema. wrote down the functional depencies. Then, with that, I made the first, second, third, and boyce-codd relational schema. For the first relational schema, I tested whether there was any multivalued attributes or nested relations. For the second relational schema, I tested whether any nonkey attributes are dependent on any partial keys. For the third relational schema, I tested whether relations have attributes that depend on each other. For the boyce-codd normalization form, I tested whether nonkey attributes determine any partial key.
