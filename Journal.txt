9/8 Today, we used all of our time to work and discuss the 3 warm up questions. The first one was mainly testing us on the concept of weak relationships. In the example, teams had a weak relationship with league and player had a weak relationship with team. This is because each league can be identified by their names, but teams with the same name can appear several times throughout all of the leagues. However, teams with same name cannot appear in the same league. Thus, teams had a weak relationship with league. The same could be explained about the weak relationship between player and team. In the second problem, it tested us on our knowledge of an "isa" relationship. We utilized the "isa" relationship to signify that a person can either be a fan or a player. The last problem tested us on how to use attributes in relationships. In the example, we defined 3 attributes for the relationship "played" between players and match.
