11/14 Our warmup assignment today was to write/generate code for a music database. We were given two choices to do so. We could draw the ER diagram using MySQLWorkbench, and then use forward engineering to get the code or we could just write the code on DataGrip by ourselves. I choose the first method because it sounded easier, however this method turned out to be extremely complicated. Next time, I will no longer choose this method anymore...
