11/17 Today, we continued to work on our music database. We also learned 3 additional commands: Limit, Order, and Select. Limit is used to choose the number of outputs displayed. Order can specify how the outputs are displayed. For example whether it should be alphabetically listed by the names or by the ID numbers. Select is used to choose which outputs are shown from a specific table.
